# yuan-website.github.io

This repository is for the website of Prof. Yuan's group at SHAO (center.shao.ac.cn/fyuan). It hosts some static files and most importantly, the club_activities.html which can be edited here directly and is used to serve website's journal club webpage (http://center.shao.ac.cn/fyuan/journalclub.html).

# For the organiser of Journal club

What needs to be modified in club_activities.html is quite straightforward - just copy the code between <tr> and </tr> and edit it accordingly! Then commit the changes and Github will do the rest of the work for you.

To make sure that Github really has deployed this page, you can check https://yuan-website.github.io/club_activities.html. Maybe you will need to press Cltr+A in order to see all the texts.

If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me an email and I will be happy to help.
